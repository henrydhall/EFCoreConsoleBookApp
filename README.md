# ConsoleApps

This is a practice project to work on an Entity Framework Core application without worrying about ASP.NET componenents.
The applications stores Book and Author objects in a database.

Currently running on:

* EF Core 5.1

## What can you do?
Current features include:
* Listing preseeded books.
* Searching books by title.
* Searching books by number of pages within +-50

## TODO:
* The next big thing is adding a book. Variables are assigned, just need to create book and author and update database.
* Searching books by everything else.
* Searching by number of pages improvements: setting range, setting range above and below.
* Searching by author.
* Making changes to existing objects.
* Take a look and make sure that the interface doesn't become too complicated. Make file with outlines.
